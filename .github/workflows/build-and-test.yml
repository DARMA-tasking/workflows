      # > Option 1: Docker image (Environment Setup="docker") WIP
      # - pull the docker image
      # - build & Test using `docker exec [container] build_and_test.sh` for example or by using an inner build_and_test docker image
      # - (TODO: copy artifacts using a volume)

      # > Option 2: Current runner (Environment Setup="local") (Future for some macos)
      # - setup dependencies here directly
      #   (Here a work needs to be done to determine how to get the dependencies script. It might be shared by the workflows repo and put in matrix)
      # - build & Test using build_and_test.sh
